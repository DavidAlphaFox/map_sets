#+TITLE: map_sets

[[https://travis-ci.org/k32/map_sets.svg?branch=master]]

It's a drop-in replacement of OTP =sets= module based on maps. It's
much faster and simpler, as it makes heavy use of =maps= BIFs.

=sets= interface and sematics are fully preserved, so it should be
sufficient to just use replace =sets= with =map_sets= in your codebase
via sed.
